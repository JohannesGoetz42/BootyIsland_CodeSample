# Welcome to the Booty Island Code Sample!

## Introduction

This Project is intended as a Code sample and is not the complete Project.

Booty Island is a Game I'm currently working on in my free time, based on the Unreal Engine 5 Early Access version. It aims to combine City Builder and Action RPG.
A Preview video of the work in progress can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sfglRWDc6gs



## Quick Start

This code sample is focused around the Building tool which allows the player to spawn buildings.
A good place to start are the `.h` and `.cpp` files for the `UBuildingTool` located under `Source\BootyIsland_Sample\<Public/Private>\Gameplay\Buildings\Components\BuildingTool.h`.

The Code Sample uses the original folder structure to provide a feeling for the original project architecture. This does cause seemingly unneccesary Folders in this project, however.
I added a .sln file in case this helps to navigate the project. It will not build due to missing depdendencies though.
